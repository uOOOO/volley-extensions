This repository was forked from [naver/volley-extensions](https://github.com/naver/volley-extensions).

It's migrated to Android SDK 28 and Android Studio in here.

But whatever related to the legacy http client for Gingerbread (SDK 9) and below was removed.

# Introduction to Volley Extensions

This library provides assistance in developing Android applications using [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/).

It provides useful classes such as various requests, disk caches, memory caches, and custom views.

Volley Extensions has been divided into following pluggable sub-projects.

 - [Volleyer](https://github.com/naver/volley-extensions/tree/master/volleyer) : Volleyer provides a very simple and much improved interface for developers to work with while using Volley. Also includes branch new features previously not in Volley.
 - [Volley requests](https://github.com/naver/volley-extensions/tree/master/volley-requests) : Contains Request classes that parses json and xml using Jackson library and Simple xml library.
 - [Volley caches](https://github.com/naver/volley-extensions/tree/master/volley-caches) : Contains improved DiskBasedCache and capable AUIL Cache for use in Volley.
 - [Volley custom views](https://github.com/naver/volley-extensions/tree/master/volley-views) : Added user interaction capabilities to NetworkImageView.

Each sub-project includes guides and samples for installation/development.

# Volley mirror dependency
This library depends on [Volley mirror project](https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley). The mirror project keeps an up-to-date version of [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/) and automatically uploads to Maven Central. 

The library will continue to keep this dependency until Volley provides an official package in Maven Central.
